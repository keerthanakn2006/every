            <h1>AUTOMOBILE ENGINEERING</h1>
            <p>The automobile was first invented and perfected in Germany and France in the late 1800s, though Americans quickly 
                came to dominate the automotive industry in the first half 
                of the twentieth century. Henry Ford innovated mass-production techniques that became standard, and Ford,
                 General Motors and Chrysler emerged as the “Big Three” auto companies by the 1920s. Manufacturers funneled their 
                 resources to the military during World War II, and afterward automobile production in Europe and Japan soared to meet growing demand. 
                 Once vital to the expansion of American urban centers, the industry had become a shared global enterprise with the rise of Japan as the leading automaker by 1980.
                 Although the automobile was to have its greatest social and economic impact 
                in the United States, it was initially perfected in Germany and France toward the end of 
                the nineteenth century by such men as Gottlieb Daimler, Karl Benz, Nicolaus Otto and Emile Levassor.</p>
