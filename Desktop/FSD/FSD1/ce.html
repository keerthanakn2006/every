            <h1>CIVIL ENGINEERING</h1>
            <p>Civil engineering, the profession of designing and executing 
                structural works that serve the general public, such as dams, bridges, aqueducts, canals, highways, power plants,
                 sewerage systems, and other infrastructure. The term was first used in the 18th century to distinguish the newly recognized profession 
                 from military engineering, until then preeminent. From earliest times, however, engineers have engaged in peaceful activities, and many of
                  the civil engineering works of ancient and medieval times—such as the Roman public baths, roads, bridges, and aqueducts; the Flemish canals;
                   the Dutch sea defenses; the French Gothic cathedrals; 
                and many other monuments—reveal a history of inventive genius and persistent experimentation.
