            <h1>Machine Tools Technology </h1>
            <p>Machine tool, any stationary power-driven machine that is used to shape or form parts made of metal or other materials. 
                The shaping is accomplished in four general ways: (1) by cutting excess material in the form of chips from the part; (2)
                 by shearing the material; (3) by squeezing metallic parts to the desired shape; and (4) by applying electricity,
                 ultrasound, or corrosive chemicals to the material. The fourth category covers modern machine tools and processes 
                 for machining ultrahard metals not machinable by older methods.  Machine tools that form parts by removing metal chips 
                 from a workpiece include lathes, shapers and planers, drilling machines, milling machines, grinders, and power saws.
                  The cold forming of metal parts, such as cooking utensils, automobile bodies, and similar items, is done on punch presses,
                   while the hot forming of white-hot blanks into appropriately shaped dies is done on forging presses.
                   Modern machine tools cut or form parts to tolerances of plus or minus one ten-thousandth of an inch (0.0025 millimetre). 
                   In special applications, precision lapping machines can produce parts that are within plus or minus two millionths of an inch (0.00005 millimetre).
                    Because of the precise dimensional requirements of the parts and the heavy cutting forces exerted on the cutting tool, machine tools combine weight 
                    and rigidity with delicate accuracy.
